      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Friendly Paws is a dog grooming business on the North East side of
        Chicago in Edison Bark - I mean Park. But there is only one employee! To
        help with scheduling her paw-esome clients, the owner would like a site
        for making appointments. That way she can spend less time barking on the
        phone and more time pampering her pals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open 7 days a week from 10am - 6pm, this app will aim to allow customers
        to sign up for (A) a Nail Trim, (B) a Hair Cut, or (C) a Bath and Tidy
        (en-tails a bath, teeth cleaning, hair cut, and nail trim). Each
        customer will have to create an account, enter their dog's name, enter
        the pampering option they would like their pal to receive, and most
        importantly - the date and time. As patrons fill up the schedule, new
        customers should be unable to reserve the booked time slots.
