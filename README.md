## Friendly Paws Scheduling App

https://youtu.be/hbB-KrrC86c

Friendly Paws is a dog grooming business on the North East side of Chicago in Edison Bark - I
mean Park. But there is only one employee! To help with scheduling her paw-esome clients,
the owner would like a site for making appointments. That way she can spend less time barking
on the phone and more time pampering her pals.

Open 6 days a week from 7:30am - 2pm on weekdays, 9am - 1pm on
Saturdays, this app will aim to allow customers to sign up for a Nail
Trim, a Hair Cut, or a Bath and Tidy (en-tails a bath, teeth cleaning,
hair cut, and nail trim). Each customer will have to create an
account, enter the pampering option they would like their pal to
receive, and most importantly - select the date and time. As patrons
fill up the schedule, new customers should be unable to reserve the
booked time slots.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
